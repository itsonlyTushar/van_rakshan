# Van Rakshan  - Guardians of Wildlife Project

The project showcases a representation of a government or NGO website that works towards wildlife conservation and protection. It includes various pages such as wildlife species data and details about different programs initiated by the government.

## Why I Built This Project

I built this project to practice and improve my React skills while working on something meaningful like wildlife conservation. It's been a great learning experience that pushed me to explore different aspects of React development.

**What I Learned Along the Way:**
- **Component Development**: I tried building my own reusable components (Pagination, Modals, Input Fields, Buttons) instead of using existing libraries. It was definitely more work, but helped me understand React fundamentals better
- **Code Organization**: I spent time thinking about folder structure and keeping my code DRY. Still learning the best practices, but I'm happy with how organized it turned out
- **State Management**: Working with Redux and Redux Thunks was challenging at first, but it really helped me understand how to manage complex state in larger applications
- **Documentation**: I made an effort to comment my code, especially in areas where I thought future me (or other developers) might need some context

This project has been a good way for me to practice putting together a complete React application while focusing on writing clean, maintainable code. There's always more to learn, but I'm pleased with how it came together.
